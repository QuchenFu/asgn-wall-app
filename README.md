# Getting Started

Before doing anything, make sure that you have committed your working solution
of the original assignment. 

For this version of the assignment, you are going to implement the spec in the
described in the edu.vanderbilt.wall.wall.WallController class but using JPA.

You DO NOT need to implement authentication or change the WallController to leverage a passed in Principal to identify the user. The user can still be supplied via an insecure "user" parameter.

You will need to modify the Post class to have the appropriate JPA annotations
and an autogenerated id member variable with the correct annotations. The type
of the id will change requiring you to update your getPost() method in the 
controller. You will also have to implement an appropriate PostRepository with
the correct annoations. Finally, you will modify your WallController to use
the repository to save / find posts. 

Run the edu.vanderbilt.wall.wall.WallApplicationTests to check if you
have implemented the spec correctly. The grading for the assignment is
embedded as comments in the test. This test is located under the
src/test/java folder and can be run from Eclipse by right-clicking on
it and selecting Run As->JUnit Test.

When you are done, turn in a zip file with your src directory and build.gradle file to Brightspace.
